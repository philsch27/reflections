1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   A remote repository would be used to share files and to facilitate collaboration.
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
   stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   It is best to keep your local branch intact without changes until you are ready add changes
   from the remote and only when you want to add changes from the remote repo.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one 
   instead of another?

   - clone copies a repository so you can work on it and only puch your changes to the original 
     when ready or simply keep an original copy.
   - branches facilitate the ability make various changes to same strand of code andi merge when desired
   - forks give the ability to make changes to a copy of a repository on github, clone that repository
     to local machine and push/pull changes without changing the original repository on github.
